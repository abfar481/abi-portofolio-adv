            <h3>the ultimate workflow machine, a new standard in high volume caf√© performance.

            <p>The KB90 is the ultimate evolution of the Linea PB form. Designed to optimize the workflow for the
                barista in the world's busiest bars by improving the ergonomics and features of the machine. The KB90 is
                named for our Board Chairman, Kent Bakke. 20 years ago, Kent imagined one of the most exciting new
                features of the KB90, the Straight-in Portafilter. Kent has always seen La Marzocco's mission to create
                machines that make the lives of the barista easier and more efficient, and the KB90 embodies this
                philosophy.</p>

            <h2>Straight in Portafilter</h2>
            <p>Designed to simplify the motions required to engage the portafilter and reduce the strain by 12 times on
                the
                barista for even greater performance and everyday usability. High volume coffee environments demand that
                a
                barista can work fast and efficiently to produce drinks during busiest periods of the day. The
                Straight-In
                Portafilter can noticeably mitigate the repetitive stress injuries occurring through its ease of action
                improving the natural workflow and output of barista.</p>

            <h2>auto brew ratio with drip prediction</h2>
            <p>Precision scales incorporated into the drip tray improve beverage consistency by stopping the extraction
                based on mass. The machine uses an algorithm called Drip Prediction to improve shot accuracy and ease of
                dialing in.</p>
